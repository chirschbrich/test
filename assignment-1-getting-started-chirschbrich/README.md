# Assignment 1: Getting Started

## 1. Install the Development Environment

Follow the steps on https://github.com/mhahsler/CS2341/#required-tools to install VS Code, CMake, etc.
Make the switch to VS Code since it is
* Used by many companies.
* Supports all programming languages you will encounter as a computer scientist. 

## 2. GitHub

1. If you do not have an account, then create one at https://github.com/
2. Work through the [GitHub's quickstart section](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart)

You should be able to clone repositories, commit and push changes and add new files to a repository.

## 3. Data Structures Countdown Program

Do the following to make sure your tools work:

- Clone this repository to your computer.
- Edit `main.cpp` so it prints a count down from 9 to 1 (using a loop) and then says "It is time for data structures."
- Compile your program using VS Code and CMake. Consult the HOWTO section for help: https://github.com/mhahsler/CS2341/#howtos
- Replace the file `output.png` with a screenshot of your program's output (see [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics)).

The screenshot will show up here:

## 4. Get Familiar With Markdown

This document uses [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). Read up on the basic [syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

GitHub automatically renders markdown documents ending in `.md`.

You can preview the rendered document in VS Code by right-clicking the file and choosing `Open Preview`. 

## 5. Compile on a Genuse Server

Work through the howto on using the Shell and SSH on https://github.com/mhahsler/CS2341/#howtos

Do the following:
1. Apply for a Genuse account.
2. Set up VS Code to connect to a Genuse Server.
3. Use the VS Code terminal to check out your repository from GitHub on the server.
4. Compile your code on the server, run your program on the server and take a screen show. Add it to the repository
   as output_genuse.png 

Make sure you learn the basics of how to use a shell (`ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `rm`, etc.).
